# Poker Tournament Manager Console Application

## Overview

This application serves as a simple console-based tool for managing poker tournaments. It provides users with an interface to organize and control various aspects of a tournament, ensuring a seamless experience for both organizers and participants.

## Development Approach

The development of this application adheres to the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology. This approach emphasizes the importance of writing tests before developing functional code, ensuring that all features are thoroughly tested and verified.

## Error Handling Strategy

In line with the application's design philosophy, **error handling** is primarily managed through the return of boolean values instead of throwing exceptions. This strategy simplifies the control flow and error management, making it easier for calling code to interpret the success or failure of operations without the overhead of exception handling.
